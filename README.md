ðŸ‘—#Fashion Recommender System

The project is a Website application for fashion recommendation using machine learning with a built-in a recommendation engine which suggests similar products to the given product.

# RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
Recommender systems are one of the most successful and widespread applications of machine learning technologies in business. Recommendation systems help to increase the business revenue and help customers to buy the most suitable product for them. Now, weâ€™ll look towards different types of filtering used by recommendation engines.
Content-based filtering
This filtering is based on the description or some data provided for that product. The system finds the similarity between products based on its context or description. The userâ€™s previous history is taken into account to find similar products the user may like.
Collaborative filtering
The recommendations are done based on the userâ€™s behavior. History of the user plays an important role. For example, if the user â€˜Aâ€™ likes â€˜Coldplayâ€™, â€˜The Linkin Parkâ€™ and â€˜Britney Spearsâ€™ while the user â€˜Bâ€™ likes â€˜Coldplayâ€™, â€˜The Linkin Parkâ€™ and â€˜Taylor Swiftâ€™ then they have similar interests. So, there is a huge probability that the user â€˜Aâ€™ would like â€˜Taylor Swiftâ€™ and the user â€˜Bâ€™ would like â€˜Britney Spearsâ€™. This is the way collaborative filtering is done.

Two types of collaborative filtering techniques are used:

User-User collaborative filtering
Item-Item collaborative filtering
